# MERN 
Learn about MERN technology
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—a powerful technology stack for web application development. Let’s dive into the details:

MongoDB: A document database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It’s great for handling unstructured data and scaling horizontally. MongoDB is the go-to choice for storing user profiles, content, comments, and more.
Express.js: This server-side web framework runs within a Node.js server. Express.js provides powerful URL routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and creating APIs. It’s fast, minimalist, and unopinionated.
React.js: At the top tier of the MERN stack, React.js is a declarative JavaScript framework for building dynamic client-side applications. It lets you create complex interfaces using simple components, connect them to the back-end server, and render them as HTML. React excels at handling stateful, data-driven interfaces.
Node.js: The premier JavaScript web server, Node.js powers the Express.js server. It allows you to write server-side code in JavaScript, making it consistent throughout the stack. Node.js interacts with MongoDB to access and update data.
